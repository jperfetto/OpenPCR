/* This is the selector for the main SlidingPanels container. This selector
 * defines the width and height of the view port for the widget. Note that
 * this selector does not set the overflow property since that is done programatically
 * by the widget. Setting the overflow property programatically ensures that
 * the contens of the widget will be fully visible should JavaScript be disabled
 * in the browser.
 *
 * If you want to constrain the width of the SlidingPanels widget, set a width on
 * the SlidingPanels container. By default, our sliding panels widget expands
 * horizontally to fill up available space.
 *
 * The SlidingPanels container is positioned relative so that content inside it
 * can be positioned relative to its upper left corner.
 *
 * Avoid placing any CSS border or padding properties on the SlidingPanels container
 * as they can affect the proper positioning and sliding animations of the contents
 * inside the container.
 *
 * The name of the class ("SlidingPanels") used in this selector is not necessary
 * to make the widget function. You can use any class name you want to style the
 * SlidingPanels container.

/* This is the selector for the container that holds all of the content panels
 * for the widget. The SlidingPanelsContentGroup container is what gets programtically
 * positioned to create the slide animation. It is also what governs the layout of
 * the panels.
 *
 * By default, the width of the container is the same as its parent, the SlidingPanels
 * container.
 *
 * You can make the panels within the SlidingPanelsContentGroup container layout
 * horizontally by giving the SlidingPanelsContentGroup container a width that is as wide
 * or larget than the sum of the widths of all of the content panels, and then floating
 * the content panels inside the SlidingPanelsContentGroup container so they all appear
 * on the same line. You may also need to float the SlidingPanels and SlidingPanelsContentGroup
 * containers to insure that none of the content panels "leak" outside of the widget.
 *
 * Avoid placing any CSS border, margin, or padding properties on the SlidingPanels
 * container as they can affect the proper positioning and sliding animations of the
 * the container within the widget.

 *
 * Avoid placing any CSS border, margin, or padding properties on the SlidingPanels
 * container as they can affect the proper positioning and sliding animations of the
